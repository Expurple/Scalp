# Scalp

An interpreter for my own simple scripting language, which I develop for fun and education.

Scalp is a basic statically typed C-like language, except for using new lines instead of semicolons, such as in Python.

To know more about language and interpreter features, visit project [wiki](https://github.com/Expurple/Scalp/wiki).

## What's new in v0.2.1 (12 Aug 2020)?

* Interpeter now points at errors with an **^**
* Fixed two big bugs with *if*s:
* 1) "*if true*"s not expecting *endif* afterwards
* 2) *endif* closing all nested *if*s at once
