# Scalp

An interpreter for my own simple scripting language, which I develop for fun and education.

Scalp is a basic statically typed C-like language, except for using new lines instead of semicolons, such as in Python.

## What's new in v0.2.0 (11 Aug 2020)?

* Added *Bool* variables and literals
* These have no operators yet
* Added *print()* support for Bool
* Added a primitive *if* statement (*if* and *endif* keywords)
* Added more detailed error messages
* Tabs in the source code are now ignored
