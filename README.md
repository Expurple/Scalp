# Scalp

An interpreter for my own simple scripting language, which I develop for fun and education.

Scalp is a basic statically typed C-like language, which howewer has some similarities to Python syntax.

To know more about language and interpreter features, visit project [wiki](https://github.com/Expurple/Scalp/wiki).
