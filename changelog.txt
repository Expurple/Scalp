== v0.1.0 ==
9 Aug 2020

* This is the first ever version of Scalp.

* It introduces an interactive Python-like interpreter, which supports:

* A type system (in which only String is present and user types can't be declared yet)

* Global variables, which can be assigned to a string literal or to another variable

* Functions aren't yet supported, but there is:

* A fake print() function which prints one string: a variable or a literal

* A fake exit() function which shuts down the interpreter

* And, sure, there are syntactical error checks.
