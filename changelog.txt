== v0.1.0 ==
9 Aug 2020

* This is the first ever version of Scalp.
* It introduces an interactive Python-like interpreter, which supports:
* A type system (in which only String is present and user types can't be declared yet)
* Global variables, which can be assigned to a string literal or to another variable
* Functions aren't yet supported, but there is:
* A fake print() function which prints one string: a variable or a literal
* A fake exit() function which shuts down the interpreter
* And, sure, there are syntactical error checks.
